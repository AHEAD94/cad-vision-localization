# cad-vision-localization
This repository provides a method to convert architectural CAD drawings into a graph-based structure representing the building layout, enabling indoor localization using computer vision techniques.

While the current implementation is not yet comprehensive and does not cover all building structures or scene understanding methods, it serves as a solid foundation for future development and can be expanded to handle a wider range of architectural layouts and indoor localization scenarios.

### Features
- Converts architectural CAD data into a graph-based structure for indoor localization.
- Utilizes computer vision techniques to enable indoor scene understanding.
- Performs indoor localization by mapping the indoor scene obtained through computer vision onto the graph structure converted from the CAD drawings.

### Future Work
- Expanding support for additional architectural layouts and converting various building structures into graph representations.
- Improving the accuracy and flexibility of indoor scene understanding to handle a broader range of environments.
- Enhancing the robustness of indoor localization by refining the process of mapping computer vision data onto the graph structure.
- Integrating more advanced computer vision techniques for real-time, precise localization and scene analysis.
